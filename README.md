# Hello I'm Panagiotis Kostopoulos

This is my personal portfolio page. Here you can find information about...me && my works. Most of the projects i have done so far had some kind of internal complexity some in terms of data manipulation, others in problems I faced understanding best practices and the tools at my disposal. This projects stands out for me, while it has no apparent internal logic, the time I spent with it was quite lavish, that is partly due to the new responsiveness aspect I introduced to the design , the complexity of different tools coming together, in terms of styling, and mainly because i wanted to showcase my journey in terms of a holistic approach spanning from designing and styling to the internal complexities of logic.
